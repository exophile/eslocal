Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."

It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."

The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	3 12 3013
		"Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Met a few spoiled tourists and got to visit Earth along the way."
	16 12 3013
		"Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore."
	10 1 3014
		`Dropped the famous band "There Might Be Riots" off on Wayfarer. They drew quite the crowd, and paid very well.`
	1 12 3014
		"Agreed to take a piece of wood from a church on Midgard for an archaeologist. Carbon dating suggests that the church was built many centuries before the discovery of the hyperdrive."
	15 12 3014
		"Returned to Midgard with Albert Foster, the archaeologist, to map the area around the church. The instruments discovered what looked like an artificial singularity. Got chased away by Deep ships before being able to look closer."
	8 5 3015
		"Hunting down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack, who have been giving the Free Worlds trouble lately."
	20 5 3015
		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	21 6 3015
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	6 7 3015
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	19 10 3015
		"Completed a lot of Coalition jobs and received permission to purchase civilian technology and ships."
	15 11 3015
		"Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
	21 11 3015
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	25 12 3015
		`Brought "There Might Be Riots" to the Hai world of Allhome after escaping a swarm of combat drones that disrupted their performance on Pilot. Ulrich spoke of a cloudy star in the Rim where he heard a voice in his head after parking his ship.`
	14 1 3016
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	22 1 3016
		"Earned a good reputation with the Free Worlds militia by taking on missions to hunt down some dangerous pirates."
	22 1 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	29 2 3016
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	29 2 3016
		"Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic."
	16 3 3016
		"The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner."
	25 3 3016
		"Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one."
	28 3 3016
		"The Free Worlds have retaken the Kornephoros system, with heavy losses on both sides. And unfortunately, there is no sign of Katya; she may have been taken prisoner by the Navy."
	3 4 3016
		"Returned some Navy prisoners of war, after they gave their parole and promised not to take part in any future battles against the Free Worlds."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."

		`The spider-like Arachi were the last of the three Coalition species to discover interstellar travel. Most members of their society owe allegiance to one of the great Arachi "Houses," organizations that are somewhat similar to guilds and that each specialize in one particular form of industry or technology.`
	Factions Coalition
		"The Coalition is an alliance of three different alien species living in peace with each other: the Saryds, the Kimek, and the Arachi. On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Heliarchs
		"The Heliarchs are the rulers of Coalition space: apparently not elected, but instead selected by merit from among the citizens of the Coalition in such a way as to ensure that all three species are equally represented. Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species."
	Factions Kimek
		"The Kimek are large insectoid aliens, and are members of the Coalition. They discovered spaceflight after the Saryds, but before the Arachi. They are intensely social creatures, preferring to live together in massive buildings with thousands of inhabitants, and many of their worlds have populations in the tens of billions, far more than any human world."
	Factions Korath
		`The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
		"Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Saryds
		"Saryds are an alien species who look suspiciously similar to the centaurs found in early human mythology. They prefer to live on worlds with as much green space as possible, and even their major cities are full of parks and gardens. Most Saryds live in small communes with up to a few dozen of them per house."
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	People "Albert Foster"
		"An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector."
	People "Alondo Gruyere"
		`Alondo grew up on Bourne, the relatively prosperous planet on the edge of the Rim that is now the capital of the Free Worlds. He served as a Republic diplomat for years before becoming convinced that Parliament was just using him to "pacify" the less developed worlds in the South with empty promises. He joined the Southern Defense Pact in the early days, before it became the Free Worlds, and is now a member of the Council.`
	People "Freya Winters"
		`Freya is an engineer, specializing in surveillance equipment but with a wide range of talents. She organized the "thousand eyes" program run by the Southern Defense Pact, which was an attempt to reduce the power of the pirate fleets in the region by tracking their fleet movements. Despite her relative lack of interest in politics, she was asked to join the Free Worlds Council because of her expertise in optimizing the distribution and management of resources.`
	People "Ijs Springborn"
		`Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
	People "Jean-Jacques Soleau"
		`Known to most people simply as "JJ," Jean-Jacques grew up in the Dirt Belt and served in the Navy for years before quitting in frustration over the fact that the Navy was no longer defending his home region of space. He now serves on the Free Worlds Council, where he is tasked with coordinating actions between the local militias and shaping them into a single fighting force that can act in concert with each other.`
	People "Katya Reynolds"
		`A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
		"Katya grew up on Hope, a Dirt Belt world that is no longer inhabited because of a supervolcano eruption that triggered a new ice age. Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely."
	People "Tomek Voigt"
		"Tomek is a young and ambitious militia commander. His brilliant tactical leadership and charismatic personality gained him quite a following in the Dirt Belt region even before the Free Worlds came into existence. He was asked to join the Council in part because of his popularity with the local militias throughout the region."

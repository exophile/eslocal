		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."

The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air."
		description "The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships."

		description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so."
		description "	Until recently, Thule was a well-known den of pirate activity, but the major tribal authorities have now forsworn piracy in the interest of keeping the Free Worlds from further meddling in their affairs. However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here."
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description "Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here."
		description "The repair shops here can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship, and in the shipyard you can buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners."
		spaceport "It is a strange but indisputable fact that anarchists smell worse than ordinary human beings. In this day and age, where even the cheapest shuttlecraft at least has a sonic shower, there is no logical explanation for it, except that anarchist tendencies must somehow go hand in hand with a tendency to reject society's norms around hygiene. Here in a space station, with nothing but recycled air to breathe, the effect is overpowering."

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
		description "	Winter is home to the Free Worlds Conservatory, a new university that is focused on making terraforming technology and expertise available at a reasonable price, as well as on ecological protection and renewal."

		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	29 1 3015
		"Apparently the Navy is suspicious of anyone who worked with the Southern Mutual Defense Pact; got questioned about it by an officer. It was unclear what his rank or position in the Navy was."
	20 6 3015
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	3 7 3015
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	2 8 3015
		"Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
	2 9 3015
		"Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant."
	2 1 3016
		"The prefects have reached a consensus that you should be considered a valuable friend of the Remnant, and shall be given permission to purchase their ships and technology."
	9 3 3016
		"Recovered data from a derelict science drone for a team of scientists, who were studying a strange red anomaly in the Terminus system. They suggest that it may be a partially collapsed wormhole."
	6 4 3016
		"Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them."
	5 5 3016
		`Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	9 6 3016
		"Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly."
	20 6 3016
		"Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships."
	22 7 3016
		`Brought "There Might Be Riots" to the Hai world of Allhome after escaping a swarm of combat drones that disrupted their performance on Pilot. Ulrich spoke of a cloudy star in the Rim where he heard a voice in his head after parking his ship.`
	7 8 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	23 9 3016
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	26 9 3016
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	19 10 3016
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	19 10 3016
		"Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic."
	6 11 3016
		"The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner."
	8 11 3016
		"Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one."
	11 11 3016
		"The Free Worlds have retaken the Kornephoros system, with heavy losses on both sides. And unfortunately, there is no sign of Katya; she may have been taken prisoner by the Navy."
	18 11 3016
		"Returned some Navy prisoners of war, after they gave their parole and promised not to take part in any future battles against the Free Worlds."
	25 11 3016
		"Visited the Syndicate and worked out a deal where they promised to stay neutral. They are expecting to profit from selling weapons to both sides in this war. Also discovered that Katya is in the Republic's custody and is accused of terrorist activity."
	9 4 3017
		"Apparently the paroled Navy prisoners from the battle for Kornephoros plan to keep their promise to not fight against the Free Worlds. They've formed a new Navy regiment guarding the far north of human space."
	19 4 3017
		"Tried to convince Poisonwood, a world adjacent to Free Worlds territory, to switch sides. But, they are fiercely loyal to the Republic because the Navy freed them from being dominated by Alpha warlords decades ago."
	26 4 3017
		"Planted some sensors on the abandoned world of Hope, as an early warning system for Navy raids on Free Worlds space. The Navy appears to be doing something on this world, as well."
	10 5 3017
		"Assisted a Kraz Cybernetics engineer known as Barmy Edward with a test of a new and extremely powerful plasma cannon turret."
	15 5 3017
		"Tomek, from the Free Worlds council, is trying to decide how to best deal with the threat of the pirates to the south of Free Worlds space."
	11 6 3017
		"The Free Worlds have finally elected a Senate, which will be convening for the first time soon on Bourne."
	13 7 3017
		"Helped to transport some items for building a public university and terraforming research center on Winter. Ijs Springborn will be one of the professors."
	24 7 3017
		"Given orders by the Free Worlds Senate to escort a diplomatic mission to the anarchist planet Thule. Tomek is not happy about bargaining with the pirates instead of fighting them."
	30 7 3017
		"Assisted Barmy Edward with another weapon test: this time, a flamethrower weapon that works by overheating and disabling its target rather than dealing lots of damage to it. It may or may not be useful in actual combat."
	4 8 3017
		"The elders on Thule do not want to join the Free Worlds, but they have agreed to crack down on pirate activity in their system and to welcome Free Worlds visitors to their planet."
	23 8 3017
		"Brought supplies to Smuggler's Den to help upgrade the station into a working deuterium refinery. No further orders from the Free Worlds, so this might be a good time to find ways to earn more money on the side."
	12 9 3017
		"Stopped on Earth with Alondo to talk to Parliament and try to head off another bloody battle. But, they were not willing to negotiate."
	29 9 3017
		"It looks like the Navy has begun using some more powerful beam weapons and torpedoes. Tasked with plundering one of the electron beam weapons so Freya can get a closer look at it."
	6 10 3017
		"Experienced a strange vision while drifting in the Ildaria system that looked like the fall of a civilization of dragon-people. The terrain on the planet of Zug looks strikingly similar to this vision."
	10 10 3017
		"Preparing for another major battle with the Navy, this time in the Rastaban system, which just recently expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds but has not been able to do so due to the Navy presence. The Free Worlds will be using a new model of warship, the Dreadnought, in this battle."
	12 10 3017
		"The Navy has been driven out of the Rastaban system. That will allow the people on Dancer, New Portland, and New India to join the Free Worlds."
	19 10 3017
		"Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to parole and release them rather than imprisoning them. Hopefully that will earn some goodwill from the Navy in the future."
	21 10 3017
		"Once again there is no immediate work to be done for the Free Worlds. This would be a good time to earn some money for an upgraded ship, if possible."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Oathkeepers
		`The "Oathkeepers" are a regiment of Navy officers who were captured by the Free Worlds and paroled on the condition that they take no further part in fighting against the Free Worlds. They are led by William Danforth, a famous Navy admiral. Their stated mission is to protect the Paradise Worlds from the pirates who live on the anarchist worlds in the far north of human space.`
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
		"Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	Factions Wanderers
		`The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
		`The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
		"It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back."
	People "Albert Foster"
		"An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector."
	People "Alondo Gruyere"
		`Alondo grew up on Bourne, the relatively prosperous planet on the edge of the Rim that is now the capital of the Free Worlds. He served as a Republic diplomat for years before becoming convinced that Parliament was just using him to "pacify" the less developed worlds in the South with empty promises. He joined the Southern Defense Pact in the early days, before it became the Free Worlds, and is now a member of the Council.`
	People "Edward Tivrusky"
		`Barmy Edward is the Chief Offensive Engineer at Kraz Cybernetics, known for his inventive and sometimes impractical weapon designs. Supposedly, his engineers gave him the "Barmy" sobriquet after an incident where an experimental epoxy cannon he was working on exploded and glued him to the ceiling.`
	People "Freya Winters"
		`Freya is an engineer, specializing in surveillance equipment but with a wide range of talents. She organized the "thousand eyes" program run by the Southern Defense Pact, which was an attempt to reduce the power of the pirate fleets in the region by tracking their fleet movements. Despite her relative lack of interest in politics, she was asked to join the Free Worlds Council because of her expertise in optimizing the distribution and management of resources.`
	People "Ijs Springborn"
		`Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
		"Ijs is now working to found the Conservatory, a publicly funded Free Worlds university that will have a particular focus on terraforming technology. Their goal is to make terraforming methods efficient enough that even Dirt Belt worlds will be able to afford them."
	People "Iktat Rek"
		"Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans."
	People "Jean-Jacques Soleau"
		`Known to most people simply as "JJ," Jean-Jacques grew up in the Dirt Belt and served in the Navy for years before quitting in frustration over the fact that the Navy was no longer defending his home region of space. He now serves on the Free Worlds Council, where he is tasked with coordinating actions between the local militias and shaping them into a single fighting force that can act in concert with each other.`
	People "Katya Reynolds"
		`A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
		"Katya grew up on Hope, a Dirt Belt world that is no longer inhabited because of a supervolcano eruption that triggered a new ice age. Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely."
		"Katya was on Clink when the Navy invaded the Kornephoros system, and was taken captive by them and imprisoned as a war criminal."
	People Sayari
		"Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well."
	People "Tomek Voigt"
		"Tomek is a young and ambitious militia commander. His brilliant tactical leadership and charismatic personality gained him quite a following in the Dirt Belt region even before the Free Worlds came into existence. He was asked to join the Council in part because of his popularity with the local militias throughout the region."
		"Tomek was removed from the Council and placed under house arrest by the Senate after he disobeyed their orders and tried to launch an attack to capture the Pirate world of Greenrock rather than pursuing the diplomatic solution that the Senate preferred."
	People "William Danforth"
		`Danforth is a famous Navy Admiral who is a folk hero throughout human space due to his fair and honorable behavior and his willingness to use his fleet to assist people in need, even when he has to go against Parliament's orders to do so. He is currently in charge of the Navy regiment who call themselves the "Oathkeepers."`

			`You find Eyes and Katya sitting in the shade of one of the few trees in the port, drinking some sort of frozen milkshakes while they stare out at the desert and talk in hushed voices. When you join them, Katya says, "I was just filling Eyes in on the Navy's recent fleet mobilization. Half the Dirt Belt is swarming with cruisers and surveillance drones right now. It's hard to believe that we can find the attackers before they do, unless they're somewhere the Navy hasn't thought to look."`
			`	"Agreed," says Eyes, "and to make matters worse, their sensors are probably much better than mine."`
			`	Katya appears to be struck by a sudden idea. "The sensors on their drones," she says, "their unmanned drones..."`
			`	Eyes glances at her, sees her expression, and says, "No, Councilor, don't even think of it. That's a horrible idea."`

			`	"Well," she says, "it started when the Syndicate began experimenting with fully automated mining facilities on uninhabitable planets. Pirates started raiding the mines to steal equipment, and the Syndicate claimed that these installations were 'colonies' and it was the Navy's job to defend them. The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy. But by the same law, those Navy surveillance drones become abandoned goods the moment their motherships leave the system."`

		spaceport "Fortunately, the spaceport and residential areas survived the bombing, which was focused only on the Navy yard and happened early in the morning, when very few people were at work."

		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

logbook
	16 11 3013
		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	13 5 3014
		"Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore."
	30 6 3014
		"Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them."
	21 8 3014
		`Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	21 10 3014
		"Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly."
	31 10 3014
		"Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships."
	7 12 3014
		"Hunting down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack, who have been giving the Free Worlds trouble lately."
	25 3 3015
		`Dropped the famous band "There Might Be Riots" off on Wayfarer. They drew quite the crowd, and paid very well.`
	14 4 3015
		"Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant."
	7 7 3015
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	3 9 3015
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	11 1 3016
		"The prefects have reached a consensus that you should be considered a valuable friend of the Remnant, and shall be given permission to purchase their ships and technology."
	27 1 3016
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	5 3 3016
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	14 3 3016
		"Earned a good reputation with the Free Worlds militia by taking on missions to hunt down some dangerous pirates."
	14 3 3016
		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	13 4 3016
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	25 4 3016
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Archons
		`Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
		"Archons consider it to be their job to enforce peace and to prevent extinction. If they are unable to prevent a species from driving itself extinct, they will still try to preserve some of what that species created as a memorial to them."
		"They are capable of communicating telepathically."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Korath
		`The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
	Factions "Void Sprites"
		`The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	Factions Wanderers
		`The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
		`The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
		"It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back."
	People "Ijs Springborn"
		`Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
	People "Iktat Rek"
		"Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans."
	People "Katya Reynolds"
		`A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
	People Sayari
		"Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well."

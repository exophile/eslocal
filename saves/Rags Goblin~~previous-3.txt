			`	Tomek climbs up onto the hull of a nearby ship and addresses the prisoners. "Hello," he says. A few of the Navy officers respond, warily. "My name is Tomek Voigt," he says. "Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am responsible for deciding your fate."`
			`	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The Council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
			`	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the Council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
			`	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
			`	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
			`	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
			`	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Emily, Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`

	planet Ingot
		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."

		"Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant."
	16 11 3013
		"Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James."
	30 11 3013
		"Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore."
	8 3 3014
		`Dropped the famous band "There Might Be Riots" off on Wayfarer. They drew quite the crowd, and paid very well.`
	29 4 3014
		"Agreed to take a piece of wood from a church on Midgard for an archaeologist. Carbon dating suggests that the church was built many centuries before the discovery of the hyperdrive."
	29 4 3014
		"Apparently the Navy is suspicious of anyone who worked with the Southern Mutual Defense Pact; got questioned about it by an officer. It was unclear what his rank or position in the Navy was."
	17 5 3014
		"Returned to Midgard with Albert Foster, the archaeologist, to map the area around the church. The instruments discovered what looked like an artificial singularity. Got chased away by Deep ships before being able to look closer."
	27 8 3014
		"Helped two teens named Joe and Maria and their daughter Jesse to escape their pirate captain. Dropped them off on Millrace where they'll start a new life."
	8 10 3014
		"Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant."
	6 12 3014
		"Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad."
	8 1 3015
		`Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	19 1 3015
		"Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament."
	15 2 3015
		"Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information."
	23 2 3015
		"Volunteered to do some recon work for the Free Worlds, as long as there is nothing illegal involved."
	21 3 3015
		"Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys, recently."
	7 4 3015
		"Hunting down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack, who have been giving the Free Worlds trouble lately."
	3 5 3015
		"Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the council member in charge of the supply convoys."
	20 5 3015
		"Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help."
	20 5 3015
		"Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic."
	6 6 3015
		"The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner."
	8 6 3015
		"Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one."
	Factions Alphas
		"The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin."
		"Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do."
	Factions Drak
		"The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction."
	Factions "Free Worlds"
		"The Free Worlds is a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility."
	Factions Hai
		"The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology."
	Factions Pirates
		"In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space."
		"Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living."
	Factions Quarg
		"The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak."
	Factions Remnant
		"Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society."
		"Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species."
		"Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath."
	Factions Republic
		"Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history."
		`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	Factions Syndicate
		"The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation."
		"The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses."
